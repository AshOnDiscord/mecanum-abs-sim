Absolute positioning using Encoder/Mecanum Bot on [Beta8397/virtual_robot](https://github.com/Beta8397/virtual_robot).  
Use Intellij(might work with Android but idk), Corletto SDK, and edit TestOdom2.java and run TestOdom2 with the mecanum bot.  
The Encoder/Odom preset is modified to return degrees and "invert" some directions.
Currently broken with certain angles ranges and spots ranges.
